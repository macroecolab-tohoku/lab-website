Hello! I am currently a 3rd year undergraduate student and my name is Kobayashi Tomoyo. I am from Miyazaki Prefecture in Kyushu, and my hometown has the very beautiful sea. Therefore, I like the sea, and living among animals, I especially like marine mammals. I am interested in the interaction between climate change and marine mammals. I also love instrumental music as well as biology!
