I am a Masters student in macroecology. Originally from Nova 
Scotia, Canada, I graduated from Dalhousie University with a B.S. Honours 
in Marine Biology and minors in ocean science and statistics. During my 
undergraduate degree, I worked on research focused on fisheries 
bycatch and conservation management of marine biodiversity, specifically 
severely-depleted groundfish species in the Northwest Atlantic. At Tohoku 
University, my study interests include the ecology of Pacific 
elasmobranchs and the potential benefits of marine protected areas, with an 
overarching goal of understanding the ecological roles and conservation of 
vulnerable sharks and rays from overfishing.
