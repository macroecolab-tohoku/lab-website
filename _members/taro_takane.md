Hi, I'm Taro Takane. I was born in the Shimoina region of Nagano Prefecture, surrounded by Japan's highest mountains. 
My childhood was filled with reading folktales about bears, wolves, and the Hihi, a giant monkey monster. 
Although I studied neuroscience as an undergraduate, my passion for nature remained strong, leading me to join this laboratory. 
My primary research interest lies in the data analysis of biogeography, particularly related to mammals, such as monkeys.
