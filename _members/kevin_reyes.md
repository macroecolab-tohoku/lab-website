I am a biologist from Mexico. I obtained a Master’s degree from the Faculty of Science at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), where I am now pursuing a PhD. My previous research focused on using ecological niche models to predict ophidism risk in the Yucatan Peninsula and to assess different niche modeling protocols to enhance model transferability and characterization of fundamental niches. My current research investigates the factors influencing species richness and distribution, specifically examining the evolutionary, ecological, and geographical causes of species richness in spiny lizards (genus Sceloporus).
