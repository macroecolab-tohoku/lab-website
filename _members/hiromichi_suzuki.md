Hi, I'm Hiromichi Suzuki. I'm a 1st year doctoral student in the Macroecology Lab. 
My research is focused on limnology and the ecology of zooplankton. I aim to understand the determinants of zooplankton community structure and dynamics using various approaches such as field studies, experiments, and data analysis.
