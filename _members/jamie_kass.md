Hi, I'm Jamie Kass. I'm a biogeographer and ecologist interested in monitoring, modeling, and mapping biodiversity. I'm originally from Queens, New York City and I'll speak with a strong accent on request. I run the Macroecology Lab at Tohoku University, and I try my best to cultivate a dynamic and international environment where everyone can do the research they are passionate about.
