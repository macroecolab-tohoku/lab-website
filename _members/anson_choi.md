Hi, I'm Anson Choi. As a fourth-year student at UC San Diego, majoring in Cognitive Science with a 
specialization in Design and Interaction, I bring a passion for understanding 
human behavior and improving user experiences to our research team. As an 
exchange student with the JYPE program, I am doing research on improving the
user interface of the Wallace EcoMod application and studying species 
distribution models.
