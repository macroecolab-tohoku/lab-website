I am a 3rd year biology major from Baylor University in Waco, Texas, USA. 
As an exchange student with the JYPE program, I am currently working in the lab 
modeling the distribution of the western diamondback rattlesnake and associated 
impacts from climate change with a specific focus on integrating microclimatic 
predictor variables.
