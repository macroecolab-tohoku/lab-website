Hi, I'm Kenshin Matsumoto. I'm from Gunma Prefecture in eastern Japan.
I'm a 4th year biology student interested in interactions 
between humans and wildlife. Currently, I am researching how the 
distribution of Japanese serow (antelope goat) is affected by deer and how it 
may shift in the future with climate change.
