I am keen to research the distribution, decline, and extinction of apex 
predators in Japan—particularly tigers, leopards, and wolves—as well as the 
Yangtze alligator, Japanese giant salamander, Blakiston's fish owl, and 
Mountain hawk-eagle. Students interested on these species can account on 
me as an adviser.

Born Brazil, my early passion for nature led me across many countries. 
Through studies in the Amazon and doctoral research in South Africa, I've 
delved into understanding human-induced extinctions and now focus on 
rewilding in Japan's diverse archipelago.
