    First-year PhD student Hiromichi Suzuki published a paper in Limnology and Oceanography  on part of his master’s research. Ecological community structure is determined in large part by spatial and environmental filters. These structures have typically been described in terms of taxonomic units (i.e., species), but are also increasingly described with trait-based units (i.e., body mass, feeding type). The drivers of trait-based community structures may differ from taxon-based ones. This study on zooplankton communities demonstrated that environmental filters play an outsize role in explaining trait-based community structures, while the explanatory power of spatial and environmental filters for taxonomic-based structures is similar. This study concludes that the determinants of zooplankton communities differ depending on the descriptive unit used to define the community structure.

    There are so many programming tools these days for species distribution models (SDMs), mainly found in different R packages. Often, researchers will ask which one they should use for their analyses. The answer: many of them! In this paper, Dr. Kass and a team of ecologists who develop many of the key R packages for SDMs explain how to take advantage of unique tools from different packages to generate workflows that meet more best-practice standards for the field. We describe these tools and their usages sequentially in the same order as a typical SDM workflow. The paper is accompanied by three vignettes that show how to take advantage of diverse tools for a full SDM analysis. We also release the sdmverse metapackage to catalog other packages and their functionalities and to visualize how they are related to each other.
