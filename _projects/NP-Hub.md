In order to reverse the current trends of biodiversity loss and degradation of natural areas, an important step is to realize and quantify the contributions of nature to people. This means expanding monitoring networks for biodiversity and pioneering new detection methods for rare species, developing better models of biodiversity to more accurately map priority areas, and connecting with private-sector partners to create financially sustainable feedback loops between research and industry. Prof. Kass manages the biodiversity modeling component, and our lab will work with collaborators in other institutions to monitor and map different metrics of biodiversity in three pilot regions in Japan. This project is funded by the COI-NEXT program offered by [JST](https://www.jst.go.jp/EN/), and it is led by Prof. Michio Kondoh, who runs the [Ecological Integration Lab](https://www.lifesci.tohoku.ac.jp/en/research/fields/laboratory.html?id=2553) at Tohoku University.
