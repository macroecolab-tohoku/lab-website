[WPI-AIMEC](https://wpi-aimec.jp/en/) is a new and interdisciplinary research institution established jointly at Tohoku University and [JAMSTEC](https://www.jamstec.go.jp/e/) to "elucidate the response and adaptation mechanisms of ecosystems to changes in the marine environment using an approach that combines ocean physics, ecology, and data science". Prof. Kass is a WPI researcher in the Ecological Complexity Research Unit, and the lab will be working on biodiversity modeling for marine systems that incorporates inputs from biogeochemical and geophysical models.
