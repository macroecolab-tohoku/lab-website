Marine biodiversity is heavily studied but still relatively unknown. One main reason is that many organisms are very difficult to detect due to cryptic habitat preferences or behavior, occupancy of deep ocean strata, or simply because they are rare within their ranges. All organisms shed DNA strands into the environment, called eDNA, and these can be sampled to significantly broaden the scope and accuracy of detections, with a good chance of  leading to the discovery of new species. This project aims to build a comprehensive reference database for understudied marine organisms that will help us match eDNA samples to species. Prof. Kass will be working with  the biodiversity modeling component, This grant is sponsored by the [Sasakawa Peace Foundation](https://www.spf.org/en/), and is led by Prof. Michio Kondoh, who runs the [Ecological Integration Lab](https://www.lifesci.tohoku.ac.jp/en/research/fields/laboratory.html?id=2553) at Tohoku University.
