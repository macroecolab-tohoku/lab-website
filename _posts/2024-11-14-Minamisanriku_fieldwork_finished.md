image: images/minamisanriku2.jpg

We finished nearly three months of wildlife monitoring in Minamisanriku today. Nearly all the undergraduate and graduate students helped us set up, check, and finally take down cameras and other devices over this period. Thanks to everyone who lent a hand! Also thanks to [Sakyu Co.](https://m-sakyu.jp/) who allowed us to monitor in their forests, guided us through them, and helped us with implementation. We are in the middle of uploading all our data to [Snapshot Japan](https://www.nies.go.jp/biology/snapshot_japan/en/index.html): >5500 photos, >100 GB of video, >2000 readings for local temperature and light intensity, and >1000 hours of sound recordings. Will report again later once we have assembled our results.
