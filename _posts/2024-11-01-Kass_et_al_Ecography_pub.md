There are so many programming tools these days for species distribution models (SDMs), mainly found in different R packages. Often, researchers will ask which one they should use for their analyses. The answer: many of them! In this paper, Dr. Kass and a team of ecologists who develop many of the key R packages for SDMs explain how to take advantage of unique tools from different packages to generate workflows that meet more best-practice standards for the field. We describe these tools and their usages sequentially in the same order as a typical SDM workflow. The paper is accompanied by three <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27312903" target="_blank">vignettes</a> that show how to take advantage of diverse tools for a full SDM analysis. We also release the <a href="https://github.com/sylvainschmitt/sdmverse" target="_blank">`sdmverse`</a> metapackage to catalog other packages and their functionalities and to visualize how they are related to each other.
