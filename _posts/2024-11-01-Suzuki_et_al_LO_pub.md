First-year PhD student Hiromichi Suzuki published a paper in [Limnology and Oceanography ](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19395590) on part of his master's research. Ecological community structure is determined in large part by spatial and environmental filters. These structures have typically been described in terms of taxonomic units (i.e., species), but are also increasingly described with trait-based units (i.e., body mass, feeding type). The drivers of trait-based community structures may differ from taxon-based ones. This study on zooplankton communities demonstrated that environmental filters play an outsize role in explaining trait-based community structures, while the explanatory power of spatial and environmental filters for taxonomic-based structures is similar. This study concludes that the determinants of zooplankton communities differ depending on the descriptive unit used to define the community structure.
