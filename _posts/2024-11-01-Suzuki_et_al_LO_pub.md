First-year PhD student Hiromichi Suzuki published a paper in Limnology and Oceanography (https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19395590). This study revealed that the determinants of zooplankton communities differ depending on the descriptive unit of community. The information on the paper is as follows:
