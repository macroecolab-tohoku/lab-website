We set up an array of wildlife cameras, local temperature sensors, and bioacoustics sensors in several mountain forests in Minamisanriku for for a two-month biodiversity monitoring project. This data collection is in collaboration with [Snapshot Japan](https://www.nies.go.jp/biology/snapshot_japan/en/index.html), which will be combining monitoring data for sites across Japan to assess the nationwide state of biodiversity.
