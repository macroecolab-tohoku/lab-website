4th-year undergrad Kenshin Matsumoto traveled to Boston and San Francisco as a fellow of the [Sendai Global Startup Campus](https://sgsc.world). He was selected by Sendai as part of an exclusive group of students to represent the city, took a five-month course, developed his own business plan, and finally pitched this plan at [CIC](https://cic.com/ja/) in Boston, Massachusetts. As part of this program, he also had the chance to visit Harvard University, MIT, and Stanford University.
