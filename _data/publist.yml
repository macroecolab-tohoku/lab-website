  description: Which R package should I use for species distribution modeling? The answer is many of them, together. We assessed the wide variety of R packages for species distribution models and highlighted how they can work together to improve methodological standards and diversify analyses in each step of a modeling workflow. We also introduce the new R package ‘sdmverse' to catalog metadata for packages, cluster them based on their methodological functions, and visualize their relationships.

- title: "Biodiversity modeling advances will improve predictions of nature’s contributions to people. "

  description: Although biodiversity has strong relationships to ecosystem services and the functions that produce them, biodiversity models are rarely used to estimate them. We highlight potential benefits of biodiversity modeling advances for predicting and mapping ecosystem services and explain how these improved predictions can help to meet goals of international frameworks for biodiversity conservation.
