# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

In the Macroecology Lab, we have members from around the world, currently 
representing 5 countries. As students typically follow their own interests, we 
collectively research a range of taxonomic groups (amphibians, insects, mammals, 
fish), systems (terrestrial, aquatic, marine), and geographic scales (Japan, 
Asia, global).
